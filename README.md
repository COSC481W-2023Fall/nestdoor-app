# nestdoor-app
A community platform for Eastern Michigan University Eagles to seek help from their flock, such as navigating the "coop" (campus) and their "nest" (department).

This project is going to be a helpful resource for EMU students.  This application allows EMU students to ask questions regarding different topics (i.e. department-specific, campus navigation, local recommendations, etc.), and respond to other poster's questions.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**-"templates" folder:** will contain the view templates for what the user sees <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**-"manage.py" file** <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**-"requirements.txt" file:** lists the packages necessary to run the code but also registers their versions <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**-"runtime.txt" file:** contains Python version to be run upon deployment

## Setup Instructions:
*This project has been written using Python Version 3.7.9.  React Version 18.2.0 will also be utilized. 
The project is dependent upon Django, for which I used version 3.2.21.* <br>
**1. Clone the repo <br>
2. Navigate to the src folder on the command line in your local repo <br>
3. Run the command "python manage.py runserver" <br>**

***To deploy on Digital Ocean,refer to our instructions for deploying on Digital Ocean: 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bUtCPEyTHIpRfFQoiVwa1NLU1t6pqlqXHrwzEljA87E/edit?usp=sharing***
<br> Source code is located in this repository.
<br> The app will be accessible once we can deploy on Digital Ocean (we need to finish a couple tasks in Sprint 1 for this)
