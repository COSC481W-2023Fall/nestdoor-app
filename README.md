# nestdoor-app
A community forum for Eastern Michigan University Eagles to seek help from their flock, such as navigating the "coop" (campus) and their "nest" (department).

This project is going to be a helpful resource for EMU students.  This application allows EMU students to ask questions regarding different topics (i.e. department-specific, campus navigation, local recommendations, etc.), and respond to other poster's questions.
